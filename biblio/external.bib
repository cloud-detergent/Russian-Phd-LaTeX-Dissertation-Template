abstract = {Tehnical terms (henceforth called terms??) are important elements for digital libraries. In this paper we presen t a domain-independent method for the automatic extraction of m ulti-word terms, from mac hine-readable special language corpora. The method, (C-value/NC-value), combines linguistic and statistical information. The first part, C-value enhances the common statistical measure of frequency of occurrence for term extraction, making it sensitive to a particular type of multi-word terms, the nested terms. The second part, NC-value, gives: 1) a method for the extraction of term context w ords (words that tend to appear with terms), 2) the incorporation of information from term context words to the extraction of terms.},

@article{Baroni2004,
	abstract = {This paper introduces the BootCaT toolkit, a suite of perl programs implementing an iterative procedure to bootstrap specialized corpora and terms from the web. The procedure requires only a small set of seed terms as input. The seeds are used to build a corpus via automated Google queries, and more terms are extracted from this corpus. In turn, these new terms are used as seeds to build a larger corpus via automated queries, and so forth. The corpus and the unigram terms are then used to extract multi-word terms. We conducted an evaluation of the tools by applying them to the construction of English and Italian corpora and term lists from the domain of psychiatry. The results illustrate the potential usefulness of the tools.},

	abstract = {We implemented a high-performing technique to automatically extract from the available documents in a given domain the shared terminology of a web community. This technique has been successfully experimented and submitted for large-scale evaluation in the domain of enterprise interoperability, by the member of the INTEROP network of excellence. In order to make the technique available to any web community in any domain, we developed a web application that allows users to i) acquire (incrementally or in a single step) a terminology in any domain, by submitting documents of variable length and format, and ii) validate on-line the obtained results. The system also supports collaborative evaluation by a group of experts. The web application has been widely tested in several domains by many international institutions that volunteered for this task.},

We show that, compared with current text analysis methods for extracting technical terminology from text, our extracted glossaries more successfully support applications requiring knowledge of domain concepts. After presenting our methods, we illustrate the output of GlossEx, our glossary extraction tool, and present an informal evaluation of its performance.},
